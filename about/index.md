The world of computer fascinates me. How a bunch of ones and zeros bundled with an enormous amount of creativity, drives the technology at this point of time in the world, is quite astonishing. From early on, my vision became clear to be a part of this community and contribute in all the ways I can.

Over the years, I have mastered a variety of software development skills and worked on numerous projects. You can see the complete list of my skills and projects on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahriken). Also, many of my projects have been open sourced and you can find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/rikenshah).

It is my honor to have published in reputed IEEE Explore Conference, my research on "Automatic Question Generation for Intelligent Tutoring Systems"
