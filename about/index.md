The world of computer fascinates me. How a bunch of ones and zeros bundled with an enormous amount of creativity, drives the technology at this time of the world, is quite astonishing. From early on, my vision became clear to be a part of this community and contribute in whatever ways I can.

Over the years, I have mastered a variety of software development skills and worked on numerous projects. You can see the complete list of my skills and projects on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahriken). Also, many of my projects have been open sourced and you can find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/rikenshah).

Recently I have developed a keen interest in fields of Natural Language Processing and Data Science. My final year project is on Abstractive Summarization using Natural Language Generation. Online course of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing by Stanford have helped me develop basic skills required to implement various solutions in these fields.
