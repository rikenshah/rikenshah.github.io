<h2 id="the-command-you-just-ran">The command you just ran</h2>

<p>Congratulations! You have started the container for this tutorial!
Let’s first explain the command that you just ran. In case you forgot,
here’s the command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cli">docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll notice a few flags being used. Here’s some more info on them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-d</code> - run the container in detached mode (in the background)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p 80:80</code> - map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker/getting-started</code> - the image to use</li>
</ul>

<p>!!! info “Pro tip”
    You can combine single character flags to shorten the full command.
    As an example, the command above could be written as:
    <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
    docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started
   </code></p>

<h2 id="the-docker-dashboard">The Docker Dashboard</h2>

<p>Before going too far, we want to highlight the Docker Dashboard, which gives
you a quick view of the containers running on your machine. It gives you quick
access to container logs, lets you get a shell inside the container, and lets you
easily manage container lifecycle (stop, remove, etc.).</p>

<p>To access the dashboard, follow the instructions for either 
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/dashboard/">Mac</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/dashboard/">Windows</a>. If you open the dashboard
now, you will see this tutorial running! The container name (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jolly_bouman</code> below) is a
randomly created name. So, you’ll most likely have a different name.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-container">What is a container?</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve run a container, what <em>is</em> a container? Simply put, a container is
simply another process on your machine that has been isolated from all other processes
on the host machine. That isolation leverages <a href="https://medium.com/@saschagrunert/demystifying-containers-part-i-kernel-space-2c53d6979504">kernel namespaces and cgroups</a>, features that have been 
in Linux for a long time. Docker has worked to make these capabilities approachable and easy to use.</p>

<p>!!! info “Creating Containers from Scratch”
    If you’d like to see how containers are built from scratch, Liz Rice from Aqua Security
    has a fantastic talk in which she creates a container from scratch in Go. While she makes
    a simple container, this talk doesn’t go into networking, using images for the filesystem, 
    and more. But, it gives a <em>fantastic</em> deep dive into how things are working.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8fi7uSYlOdc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="what-is-a-container-image">What is a container image?</h2>

<p>When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided 
by a <strong>container image</strong>. Since the image contains the container’s filesystem, it must contain everything 
needed to run an application - all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. The 
image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables,
a default command to run, and other metadata.</p>

<p>We’ll dive deeper into images later on, covering topics such as layering, best practices, and more.</p>

<p>!!! info
    If you’re familiar with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chroot</code>, think of a container as an extended version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chroot</code>. The
    filesystem is simply coming from the image. But, a container adds additional isolation not
    available when simply using chroot.</p>
